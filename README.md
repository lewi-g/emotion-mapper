## App Purpose

- I want to build an app that helps a person track what their emotions are using this chart below. A user will start from the center of the circle and go out to the edges. 
- Help a person be aware of the nuances of their emotions. (not growing up with awareness etc….)
- Help a person see trends in their lives. 
- If a person sees a trend where they’re unhappy in a particular situation often, they can choose to avoid situation in the future
- If a person feels awesome. Empowered etc… in  a situation, they can choose to pursue those activities more. 
- Build awareness and help in decision making. 
- Most apps like this cost money.
